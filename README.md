Testausserveri's J solutions to the [Project Euler problem set](https://projecteuler.net)


## J? What? and why?
>J is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is particularly suited to the mathematical, statistical, and logical analysis of data. It is a powerful tool for developing algorithms and exploring problems that are not already well understood.

We're writing our solutions in J because it's ~~painful~~ Fun and Exciting, and we like ~~pain~~ fun!

In all seriousness, we're trying out J both as a fun challenge to ourselves
and as a way to advance our understanding of mathematics and functional programming.
J also lets us write concise and symbolically dense solutions that solve the problems
in clever ways.
